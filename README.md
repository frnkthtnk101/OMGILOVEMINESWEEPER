# OMGILOVEMINESWEEPER
Was Orginally intended as a pet project while I was waiting to go on vacation  
It is very basic Minesweeper game.

# How it works
This program is a console game intended to be used to interact with a computer  
rather than a human being. It was supposed to be a dfs project that was never  
finished.
The Main programm interacts with a class called minesweeper. The class contains  
two maps. _Map is a the what is intailized with bombs and _Places is what the user  
would see and make educated guesses.
